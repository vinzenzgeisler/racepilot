# Current MSC hardcodings and Cloud coupling inventory

This inventory is a **current fact** snapshot from 2026-08-15. It records verified
findings that must drive follow-up work for the architecture in
[ADR 0001](../adr/0001-editions-shared-core-and-deployment-modes.md). Target ownership
is described in the [repository/module map](repository-module-map.md). Resource-level
security classification and negative tests are maintained in the
[tenant resource inventory](../security/tenant-resource-inventory.md).

## Method and limitations

The required backend, frontend, marketing, master-plan, and SaaS-concept sources were
inspected. File trees, manifests, README files, workflows, infrastructure config,
schema, routes, workers, auth, storage, mail, frontend runtime config, event context,
and marketing components were read. Text searches covered case variants and related
terms for MSC/Dreiecksrennen identities, domains/email, tenant/organization/event,
AWS services, Cognito, SES, S3, RDS, Vercel, Stripe, deployment, and CI.

`rg` was attempted first but is not installed in the execution environment. Searches
therefore used recursive `grep` and `find`. Generated/dependency and VCS directories
(`.git`, `node_modules`, backend `dist`/`cdk.out`, frontend `dist`, marketing `.next`),
lockfiles, and binary assets were excluded from content searches. Evidence is from the
checked-out working trees only, not every Git branch or history. Text search cannot
prove the absence of dynamically assembled values, external configuration, or
undeclared production resources. Line numbers can drift after source changes.

“No module found” means no matching source/module was found within that scope; it is
not an audit of external accounts. The inventory distinguishes grouped repetitions
from individual semantic couplings and does not claim a secret scan or production
security assessment.

## Backend: verified MSC-specific coupling

| ID | Verified finding and evidence paths | Why it blocks a shared product | Follow-up obligation |
|---|---|---|---|
| B-MSC-01 | Repository/workspace identity and stack naming are `dreiecksrennen`: `MSC-Event-Backend/package.json:2`, `api/package.json:2`, `infra/package.json:2`, `README.md:1`, `infra/lib/config/dev.ts:8,15`, `infra/lib/config/prod.ts:17,21`, `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml:117,248,345`, and stack lookups in `scripts/phase3-smoke-test.ps1` and `scripts/public-registration-dev-readiness.ps1`. | Operator identity is embedded in package and build/deployment resource names. | Introduce neutral names and a migration plan; do not rename live resources without explicit state/import/rollback planning. |
| B-MSC-02 | Organizer sender defaults are embedded in `infra/lib/config/dev.ts:19`, `infra/lib/config/prod.ts:26`, and `api/src/mail/ses.ts:4-5,23-28`. Mail sign-offs/default branding also appear in `api/src/mail/i18n.ts:71,92,113,134` and `api/src/mail/rendering.ts:718,748`. | Sender and brand are neither tenant configuration nor provider-neutral defaults. | Resolve validated sender/branding server-side per organization; Community requires operator config and Cloud enforces tenant sender policy. |
| B-MSC-03 | Legal controller, address, chairman, club-specific membership/payment language, privacy and media consents are source constants in `api/src/routes/publicLegalTextsSource.ts:77-873` across German, English, Czech, and Polish. | Legal content is customer-specific and cannot be inherited by another installation/tenant. | Move versioned legal content and controller data into organization/event configuration with required-field validation and immutable consent evidence. |
| B-MSC-04 | Entry-confirmation defaults contain organizer, website, payment recipient and bank name in `api/src/domain/entryConfirmationConfig.ts:71-93`, repeated by seed migration `api/migrations/0043_app_config.sql:16-32`; contact/organizer fallbacks and the MSC logo key appear in `api/src/docs/entryConfirmation.ts:19,22,765,829`. | Documents and payment instructions can expose the wrong operator. | Migrate existing values into the default MSC organization; require organization/event-owned document configuration and branded asset references. |
| B-MSC-05 | PDF metadata/copy is MSC-specific in `api/src/docs/pdf.ts:257,333`; signing uses a fixed location in `api/src/routes/adminSigning.ts:432`; `/public/mail/logo` returns `public/mail/msc-logo.png` in `api/src/handler.ts:322-324`; the source asset is `infra/assets/mail-logo/msc-logo.png`. | Generated/legal artifacts are branded globally. | Resolve artifact metadata, location, and assets from validated tenant/event config; version the values used for each artifact. |
| B-MSC-06 | Waiver-signed seed mail hardcodes the MSC address/sign-off in `api/migrations/0063_waiver_signed_mail_template.sql:31-49`; placeholder examples also use the MSC/event in `api/src/mail/placeholders.ts:8,36,64` and `api/src/mail/templateContracts.ts:248`. | Seeded content becomes customer-visible and examples encourage copied defaults. | Replace seeds with neutral templates and explicit required organization values; migrate current templates without losing history. |
| B-MSC-07 | Marshal import discovers two 2024 events whose names contain `Dreieck` in `api/src/routes/adminMarshals.ts:521`. | This is hidden, event-name-based customer business logic. | Replace it with explicit, organization-scoped import source selection and validation. |
| B-MSC-08 | API/header/scope identifiers embed MSC: `api/src/handler.ts:247`, `api/src/http/response.ts:22`, `api/src/http/auth.ts:85-100,229,271-274`, `infra/lib/stacks/auth-stack.ts:106,157`, and `infra/lib/stacks/api-stack.ts:341`. | Public contracts and automation policy are tied to the predecessor identity. | Version and migrate neutral authorization/header contracts; keep permissions server-side and do not turn legacy headers into tenant authority. |
| B-MSC-09 | Dashboard geocoding sends a fixed User-Agent with the MSC domain in `api/src/routes/adminDashboard.ts:489`. | A third-party request identifies the reference customer for every deployment. | Make compliant operator contact/product identification deployment configuration, with Cloud-managed and Community-required values. |
| B-MSC-10 | Migration runner references `/dreiecksrennen/github/pat` and repository `MSC-Event-Backend` in `infra/lib/stacks/migration-runner-stack.ts:28,35,75`. | Infrastructure automation assumes one secret name and predecessor repository. | Remove repository-token coupling from product code; use deployment-owned artifact/version inputs and least-privilege credentials. |
| B-MSC-11 | Legacy identifiers and customer fixtures are repeated in public contracts/tests and operational documentation: `api/openapi.json`, `api/tests/{doublestarter-migration,entry-confirmation-pdf,lifecycle-mail,mail-rendering-contract,payment-reference,support-auth}.test.js`, `docs/feature-branch-dev-environment.md`, `docs/github-actions-cicd.md`, `docs/phase5-handover.md`, and `docs/privacy/legal-texts-v1.md`. | Renaming only runtime code would leave contracts, assertions, examples, and runbooks inconsistent. Some fixtures intentionally preserve migration evidence. | Classify each occurrence as a versioned legacy contract, migration fixture, or replaceable product identity; update consumers and retain explicit MSC migration fixtures where needed. |

## Backend: verified Cloud/provider and tenancy coupling

| ID | Verified finding and evidence paths | Architectural impact | Follow-up obligation |
|---|---|---|---|
| B-CLD-01 | `MSC-Event-Backend/infra/bin/app.ts` always assembles AWS CDK Auth and Storage stacks and conditionally Data/API/Migration stacks; `infra/lib/stacks/api-stack.ts` deploys API Gateway, Lambda, EventBridge schedules, IAM, CloudWatch Logs, Cognito authorizer, SES/S3/RDS access. | The only deployment assembly is AWS-specific and combines shared runtime with Cloud infrastructure. | Preserve AWS as a Cloud adapter/assembly; add a separate Community assembly against public ports. |
| B-CLD-02 | Runtime database bootstrap directly imports Secrets Manager and RDS Signer in `api/src/db/client.ts:3-4`, unconditionally loads a secret through Secrets Manager (`:57-71,213-230`), requires `DB_SECRET_ARN` (`:32-38`), defaults the RDS CA URL (`:138-140`), and requires AWS region for IAM auth (`:191-193`). It has no `DATABASE_URL` path; the partial URL support is confined to the separate migration/seed tooling inventoried in B-CLD-10. | Shared runtime persistence bootstrap assumes AWS secrets/RDS. | Define a provider-neutral database configuration/credential port and test ordinary PostgreSQL in Community plus managed credentials in Cloud. |
| B-CLD-03 | Storage directly imports S3/presigning in `api/src/docs/storage.ts:1-2` and requires `DOCUMENTS_BUCKET`/`ASSETS_BUCKET` (`:5-15`). Event-only object paths have no organization prefix: vehicle images in `api/src/routes/publicRegistration.ts:1432`, documents in `api/src/routes/adminDocs.ts:130` and `api/src/docs/entryConfirmation.ts:1000`, exports in `api/src/routes/adminExports.ts:144`, mail attachments in `api/src/routes/adminMail.ts:2946`, and signing evidence in `api/src/routes/adminSigning.ts:837-839`. | Community cannot select a local/S3-compatible adapter cleanly, and Cloud object isolation lacks a tenant namespace. | Extract an object-store port and migrate keys to `tenant/{organizationId}/...`, including legacy lookup and negative access tests. |
| B-CLD-04 | Mail transport directly imports the AWS SES client in `api/src/mail/ses.ts:1`; API IAM grants `ses:SendEmail`/`ses:SendRawEmail` in `infra/lib/stacks/api-stack.ts`. | Community SMTP and tenant-aware Cloud sender policies are not adapter boundaries. | Extract mail transport and sender-policy ports; provide SMTP/reference and managed implementations. |
| B-CLD-05 | User administration directly imports Cognito Identity Provider in `api/src/routes/adminIam.ts:1-13`, requires `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` (`:71`), and uses AWS region (`:67`). Auth config and authorizer are Cognito-specific in `api/src/http/auth.ts` and `infra/lib/stacks/auth-stack.ts`. | Generic OIDC validation and organization membership are absent. | Introduce a generic OIDC/authentication contract and a separate membership/permission service; retain Cognito only as a Cloud adapter. |
| B-CLD-06 | The schema at `api/src/db/schema.ts:18-1041` defines `event` and event-owned resources but no organization/tenant table or `organization_id`. `app_config` at `:47` is global. A partial unique index permits one global current event at `:41-44`; routes query `event.isCurrent` globally, including `publicRegistration.ts:1295`, `adminEvents.ts:168`, and `technicalInspection.ts:90`. | Event is the highest isolation boundary; the model cannot represent many organizations safely. | Add organization ownership, tenant context, composite constraints/query scoping, RLS defense, and migrate existing rows to one explicit MSC organization. |
| B-CLD-07 | Scheduled workers are global Lambda handlers: email and retention functions/schedules are created in `infra/lib/stacks/api-stack.ts:134-184,306-314`; retention SQL in `api/src/jobs/privacyRetentionWorker.ts` operates by time/event without organization context. | A future multi-tenant worker could process data without an explicit tenant boundary. | Require organization on messages/jobs, partition work, scope all worker queries/audit, and add cross-tenant job tests. Platform-wide maintenance must enumerate tenants server-side. |
| B-CLD-08 | Production config uses `dbConnectivityMode: 'public_budget'`, `dbUseIamAuth: false`, and `dbPublicAccess: true` in `infra/lib/config/prod.ts:40-52`. | This current budget profile is not the accepted managed multi-tenant target. | Implement and verify a private Cloud database profile, pooling/credentials, backups and restore before Cloud multi-tenant readiness. |
| B-CLD-09 | Backend CI/CD assumes GitHub Actions, AWS OIDC roles, CDK, CloudFormation, and direct RDS lifecycle/deployment in `MSC-Event-Backend/.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`. Common validation runs API tests and an infra build but no deployment-mode matrix. | Useful current CI exists, but it neither validates Community nor proves tenant isolation. | Implement the matrix in [required CI coverage](ci-coverage.md); keep deployment jobs separate from portable product checks. |
| B-CLD-10 | Database migration/setup tooling also imports AWS Secrets Manager directly: `api/src/tools/doublestarterMigration.ts:5,267-287` and `api/scripts/seed-dev-current-event.js:4,84-106`. Both accept `DATABASE_URL`, but otherwise resolve AWS secret ARNs; the seed script also selects an AWS region and instantiates `SecretsManagerClient`. | Community can use the URL branch, but these otherwise reusable tools still load provider-specific dependencies and embed Cloud credential-resolution behavior. A provider-neutral Community distribution cannot treat database tooling as part of the shared boundary without accounting for that coupling. | Route migration and setup tools through the same provider-neutral database configuration/credential port as runtime bootstrap, or isolate their AWS resolution in a Cloud adapter; exercise the `DATABASE_URL` path in Community migration and seed tests. |
| B-CLD-11 | Operational image-key repair directly imports and calls S3, then selects every vehicle with an image key and updates by vehicle ID without organization context in `api/scripts/repair-vehicle-image-keys.js:3,50-79,86-121`. Restore likewise calls S3 and updates vehicles by ID without organization context in `api/scripts/restore-vehicle-image-keys.js:3,44-95`; its restore manifest embeds 14 specific customer-data vehicle IDs and the same fixed event identifier in event-scoped `uploads/{eventId}/vehicle-images/...` object keys (`:8-22`). | These scripts couple maintenance to one provider and can inspect or mutate vehicle/object data without a customer boundary. In a multi-tenant database or bucket, an unscoped repair or a stale/wrong hardcoded restore manifest risks cross-tenant disclosure, restoration, deletion-marker changes, or corrupt image references. | Replace them with provider-neutral object-store and database maintenance ports that require a trusted `organizationId`, scope vehicle selection/updates through organization-owned events, and use `tenant/{organizationId}/...` keys. Migrate legacy event-only keys with an explicit event-to-organization mapping, idempotent dry-run/apply reporting and rollback evidence; permit legacy reads/restores only after ownership validation, and add negative isolation tests proving one organization cannot enumerate, probe, restore, or update another organization's objects or vehicles. |

## Product frontend: verified MSC-specific coupling

| ID | Verified finding and evidence paths | Why it matters | Follow-up obligation |
|---|---|---|---|
| F-MSC-01 | Contact/website defaults are fixed in `MSC-Event-Frontend/src/config/public-info.ts:1-17` and repeated in `.env.development:7-8`, `.env.production:8-9`, `.env.local.example:9-10`, and `scripts/sync-dev-env.ps1:33-34`. | Another operator can display MSC contact/legal destinations. | Supply validated organization/event contact and legal links from the server bootstrap; remove customer defaults. |
| F-MSC-02 | `src/app/i18n/anmeldung-i18n.tsx:13-24,303-314,575-585,860-871` embeds the 12th Oberlausitzer Dreieck, MSC contact, and copyright in four locales. | Translated domain UI is also customer content. | Separate reusable translations from server-supplied event/organization content. |
| F-MSC-03 | Branding is compiled into `msc-logo.png` and `src/app/document-meta.tsx:3-112`; HTML and manifests embed MSC names in `admin.html:7-13`, `public/admin.webmanifest:3-5`, and `public/inspection.webmanifest:3`. Admin shell/login also say MSC in `src/app/layouts/admin-layout.tsx:21,51` and `src/pages/admin/login-page.tsx:142-143`. | One frontend build cannot safely brand multiple tenants. | Render titles/icons/manifest strategy from sanitized server branding with neutral fallbacks; verify cache/host separation. |
| F-MSC-04 | Mail design lab contains MSC logo, event names, verification URL and sign-off in `src/pages/admin/mail-design-lab-page.tsx:125-276,1215,1310,1426-1427`. | Preview/demo content can leak into real tenant templates or mislead operators. | Use synthetic preview fixtures or organization/event data, clearly separated from persisted templates. |
| F-MSC-05 | MSC-prefixed local/session storage, cookie, runtime-global and header names occur in `src/app/auth/auth-store.ts:1-3`, `src/app/auth/cognito.ts:3-8`, `src/app/i18n/anmeldung-i18n.tsx:5`, `src/pages/admin/{communication-page,entry-detail-page,marshals-page,settings-page}.tsx`, `src/pages/public/anmeldung-page.tsx:868`, `src/services/{admin-marshals.service,admin-signing.service}.ts`, `src/services/api/http-client.ts:9,53,66,145`, and `public/runtime-config.js:1-3`. | Names are predecessor-specific and storage may collide across organizations/hosts. | Version neutral keys and scope tenant-specific browser caches by trusted bootstrap identity; migrate/expire legacy keys. |
| F-MSC-06 | Legacy naming is repeated in frontend contracts and documentation: `api/{openapi,entry-confirmation-config.openapi,entry-orga-code.openapi}.json`, `README.md`, `docs/BACKEND_MAIL_AGENT_PROMPT_TRACKLINE_V2.md`, `docs/BACKEND_MAIL_HTML_DRAFTS_TRACKLINE_V2.md`, `docs/DEPLOY_ENV.md`, `docs/feature-branch-local-dev.md`, and `docs/github-actions-cicd.md`. | Contract copies and operational instructions can drift from the neutral server contract. | Establish one versioned contract source, regenerate consumers, and mark retained MSC migration/reference examples explicitly. |

## Product frontend: verified provider and authority coupling

| ID | Verified finding and evidence paths | Architectural impact | Follow-up obligation |
|---|---|---|---|
| F-CLD-01 | Auth UI is Cognito-specific through `src/app/auth/cognito.ts`, runtime Cognito fields in `src/app/auth/auth-context.tsx`, `src/services/api/http-client.ts`, and `.env*`; `scripts/sync-dev-env.ps1:12-29` reads CloudFormation and embeds a concrete Cognito domain/client ID. | Community generic OIDC is not an explicit adapter, and local development assumes the current AWS stack. | Introduce provider-neutral OIDC UI configuration supplied by the server; keep Cognito mapping in Cloud assembly only. |
| F-CLD-02 | `window.__MSC_RUNTIME_CONFIG__` is mutable browser state (`public/runtime-config.js`; `src/services/api/http-client.ts:53,66`) and currently carries API/auth behavior. | Browser runtime values cannot be trusted for deployment mode, tenant, capability, entitlement, permission, or role. | Replace/augment it with server bootstrap for presentation; enforce every sensitive decision server-side as ADR 0001 requires. |
| F-CLD-03 | `src/services/api/event-context.ts:54-124` caches one global public/admin current event and falls back from unauthorized admin lookup to the public current event. It carries no organization or host context. | A multi-tenant single build needs host/membership-scoped caches and fail-closed admin context. | Key caches by server-issued organization/bootstrap version; remove authorization fallback as a source of admin context. |
| F-CLD-04 | Frontend workflow directly installs/deploys/promotes with Vercel and writes MSC/Cognito runtime config in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml:43-294`; cleanup calls Vercel API in `scripts/cleanup-vercel-preview-deployments.mjs`. | The product build/deploy path is provider-specific and has no Community packaging path. | Separate portable build/E2E from Vercel Cloud deployment; add Community packaging and both mode jobs. |

## Marketing site: verified coupling and claim risks

Paths prefixed with `racepilot/` refer to the separate marketing-site repository as it
was named at snapshot time, not to this repository (see the
[repository naming note](repository-module-map.md#repository-naming-note)).

| ID | Verified finding and evidence paths | Architectural impact | Follow-up obligation |
|---|---|---|---|
| M-01 | MSC reference and Dreiecksrennen copy is embedded in `racepilot/components/Hero.tsx:23`, `SocialProof.tsx:21-29`, and `ProductShowcase.tsx:232`; the contact placeholder references an MSC example in `Contact.tsx:53`. | This is intentional marketing/reference content rather than tenant runtime data, but accuracy and consent still need ownership. | Keep it out of product runtime modules; review reference permission and claims separately. |
| M-02 | Pricing claims Community source/Docker and Cloud availability in `racepilot/components/Pricing.tsx:8-50`, while the inspected product repositories contain no Community distribution or Cloud control plane. GitHub links are placeholders in `Footer.tsx:16` and `Nav.tsx:27`. | Marketing can imply editions are available before release evidence exists. | Gate edition availability claims and links on actual release evidence; label roadmap/pre-release state. |
| M-03 | `racepilot/README.md:32-36` recommends Vercel deployment, but no marketing workflow was found. | This is hosting guidance/boilerplate, not evidence of an active deployment or product architecture. | Document real marketing deployment separately; keep it independent of product availability. |

## Verified absences and open search limits

- **Verified within the schema source:** no `organization` or `tenant` table/column was
  found in `MSC-Event-Backend/api/src/db/schema.ts`; event is the current top-level
  business separator.
- **Not found in inspected sources:** subscription, billing, or entitlement modules;
  a Cloud tenant/domain control plane; a Community container/Compose distribution;
  or a server-issued deployment-mode/capability bootstrap.
- **Not proven absent outside scope:** external AWS/Vercel configuration, untracked
  files, other branches, private repositories, deployed functions, databases, DNS,
  secrets, and account-level policy were not inspected.

Follow-up workers must re-run the inventory against the then-current source and add
newly discovered couplings rather than treating this snapshot as permanently
exhaustive.

Issue #38 performs a resource-focused snapshot across the backend, frontend, MSC
operations CLI and signing terminal. Its
[evidence boundary](../security/tenant-resource-inventory.md#status-and-evidence-boundary)
is intentionally static and does not supersede the limitations above.
